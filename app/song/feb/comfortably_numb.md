# SongFacts

1. The lyrics of "Comfortably Numb" were inspired by Roger Waters' experience of being injected with a muscle relaxant before a 1977 concert in Philadelphia when he was suffering from hepatitis. He felt a disconnection from reality, which he channeled into the song.
2. During the live performances of The Wall tour, Roger Waters and David Gilmour performed the song on top of the wall that was built on stage. Gilmour was elevated high above the stage for his solos.
